# Mendelian Randomization: Chapter 2

## Introduction:

	Mendelian randomization is a method to include genetic variation as an 
	instrument variable in observational studies. It can be used for any type 
	of observational study. For a genetic variation to be acceptable as an 
	instrument variable, it has to satisfy three criteria:

	*1. The genetic code should be directly related to the exposure. 
	*2. The genetic code should not be related to any other confounding factor 
	that would influence outcome.
	*3. The genetic code should influence the outcome only via the exposure and 
	not via any other pathway. 

	By using the genetic variant as an IV, we are constructing a natural randomized 
	experiment. Using this method, we can obtain a causal inference regarding the 
	influence of the exposure on the outcome. We can use more than 1 genetic variant
	by combining them into 1 IV or using more than 1 IV simultaneously.
